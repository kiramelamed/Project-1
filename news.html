			<h3>Donald Trump's tweets this week, rated from 1 to 5 Trumps</h3>

			<p>Trump has gone far beyond what other politicians or campaigns have done and developed his own unique Twitter style. The Trumpiest tweets have some combination of braggadocio about the billionaire's supposed awesomeness, personal and petty insults aimed at people he's feuding with, and disciplined recitation of campaign talking points - with some bizarre, unpredictable, offensive, or factually inaccurate twist. All of that has to be packed into a mere 140 characters.</p>

			<h3>Fox's Trump-Themed USA-Mexico 'Hype' Video is Deplorable</h3>

			<p>As if you needed any more reason to hate Fox's soccer coverage. Aside from Gus Johnson's abominable commentating, Fox Soccer is apparently trying to ruin all things U.S. Soccer-related—and, by extension, the whole country. The latest incident? A deplorable Donald Trump-themed 'hype' video.</p>

			<p>Last month, TV Azteca came up with their own brilliant hype video, comprised of chopped-and-screwed bits of Donald Trump's xenophobic rant of a campaign announcement speech, which simultaneously clowned Trump and the USMNT. The result wasn't simply comedic and wry, but also empowering for a country that tethers its national pride to its national team.</p>

			<h3>'I'm Really Rich': Donald Trump and the Art of Having No Shame</h3>

			<p>Donald Trump is descending from the sky on an escalator. In front of him: his wife Melania—infomercial posture, infomercial teeth, skin smooth like fresh tinfoil, wearing the distinctly impenetrable look of someone who is both bored and wearing more expensive shoes than you. Along the railing next to them: delirious women with mangled teeth shouting and looking for a camera, here for Donald Trump, here for delirium itself, men with bad haircuts, wearing jean shorts, shirts that don't fit, socks with failing elastic crumpled around their ankles. </p>
